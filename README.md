# Projects Summary

#Human Resource Retention:
We are trying to predict which employees are likely to leave the organization, so that the business can take actions to bring down the attrition rate. 

#Predicting Insurance Premiums:
We want to predict the insurance premiums of the customer based on given attributes such as Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker and Region

#Loan Default Prediction:
As part of this project we want to predict which customers are more likely to default on their loan applications so that the bank can take an informed decision before sanctioning a loan to a customer.
